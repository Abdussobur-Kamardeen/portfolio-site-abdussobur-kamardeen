                    <p>The approach I took was making the website seem more user friendly/engaging. By offering previews so users always know what they are looking for. Where, they could have different food categories previewed in the home page. It will be a bit more interactive to users. My web app will be set apart by making it less compact. It wouldn`t have too much content in the home page. Only the main things the users will be interested in. There`s a lot of vegan people now and knowing they have an option it makes them get to their destinations quicker. So, the app is meant to cater to a variety of people.

                    <h3>Good</h3>
                    <p>I really enjoy the overall layout and spacing of all elements in the design. The interface is clean and easy to follow, and your choice of typeface is exceptionally readable.</p>
                    <p>I really like the layout of your app, the header image fits really well with your text and colour scheme. I really like how you used the spoon icons to show the difficulty of the recipe. I like the way your logo expands as the page gets larger. Doesn`t distract from the content and is visually pleasing</p>

                    <p>It looks like there are three different typefaces being used, it would be more consistent to limit your typefaces to one or two and use sizing/weights to show hierarchy.</p>

                    <p>The challenges I faced were design challenges and knowing exactly what to include in the final screens to make sure all the user requirements were met. As I`m someone who hasn`t been ona recipe app before it was a bit challenging to know exactly how to display what consumers need. 
                        I am someone who has always wanted to look for things to cook, but I`m not the masses which meant I had to try and look at different perspectives that could somewhat align with the consumers.
                        I overcame these when I conducted some user testing and interviews to ask my tutor, mentor and peers in the UX/UI community for help. Their feedback gave me a different insight on how to approach it using UX.</p>

                    <p>Creating this recipe web app has shown me various way to critically think like a user. It was a great experience that made me question myself. Do I make design decisions based on what I think the consumers want to see or what the consumer actually want to see? For a better experience. It`s easy to confuse the two because I thought about the ideas that consumers could want without actually thinking about the consumers were seeking from other recipe apps visually that my app could provide.
                        This made it a positive experience to always think about the experience of consumers both critically and visually. So, that the apps could receive positive feedback.</p>
